# Perform Other Charm Operations

Other charm operations such as `deploying`, `publishing`, and `upgrading` are identical to those for charms written in Python or other languages. The `goops` charm framework does not change the way you interact with Juju for these operations. For more information on these operations, refer to the [Juju documentation](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/).
