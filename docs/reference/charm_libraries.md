# Charm Libraries

We maintain a set of Charm Libraries for `goops` charms at [github.com/gruyaume/charm-libraries](https://github.com/gruyaume/charm-libraries) for the following integrations:

- [`tls_certificates`](https://github.com/gruyaume/charm-libraries/tree/main/certificates): Securely request and manage TLS certificates.
- [`loki_push_api`](https://github.com/gruyaume/charm-libraries/tree/main/logging): Push logs to a Loki instance.
- [`prometheus_scrape`](https://github.com/gruyaume/charm-libraries/tree/main/prometheus): Send metrics related information to a Prometheus instance to allow scraping.
- [`tracing`](https://github.com/gruyaume/charm-libraries/tree/main/tracing): Receive tracing URLs from a tracing server.

If you need a Charm Library that is not listed here, consider creating it by contributing to the [charm-libraries repository](https://github.com/gruyaume/charm-libraries).
